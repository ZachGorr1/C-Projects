# C-Projects

Here are multiple examples of projects i completed in C. These projects were Assignments in my COP 1000C, and COP 2220C.


Arry Assingment = In this code, i was asked to show an example of arrays and how use them, moving through them, reorganizing them. Also in this project we had to show the use of a working menu for the user.

Messing With Stings = In this code, i was asked to take input of a users chose of string up to 100 characters. After reciveing the users sting, it prints the users string in reverse order, and also in a pyrimd. 

Structs = In this code. I was asked to create a custom data type in C(struct). With this custom data type it had to have multiple variables of different types. After creating this custom data type, ask the user to create and fill in their information into the data type.

Heaps And Stacks = In this code, i was asked to create two different structs of a book type. With common information a book might have like an ISBN number, author, and number of pages. After getting input from the user it stores the different books into a linked list within the users memory.

Linked List = In this code, i was asked to create a data type of patients and different atributes a normal patient would have. It would then take the patients and add them to a linked list within the users memory.

Movie Menu = In this code, it was my final project for my COP 1000C. I decided to make a moive theater Menu, including Moives, Snacks, and Drinks. The user may chose which movie they would like to see, and how many drinks and snacks they want. The porgram will then give the user a total based on everything the selected to watch, eat, and drink.
